# Cloud Noodle Bar

## The file structure

When you enter `cloud-noodle-bar/`, you'll be greeted by a fairly large project folder, but do not fear! Here's the folder structure of the app: `public/` contains all the image assets that we need. `node_modules/` contains all the needed node packages that have been installed with `npm install --save NODE_MODULE` like stripe or firebase-functions.

```
cloud-noodle-bar/
  node_modules/
  public/
  src/
```
`src/` contains the actual code. 

## What We Work With

## The UI

Welcome to the client site source code! This is a React app, which you can learn more about [here](https://reactjs.org). On top of React, we use [MUI](https://mui.com) for styled, prebuilt components. Checkout MUI Core. We used react-bootstrap before, but it was a pain and had less documentation.

## Backend Services
This website is connected to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for running backend processes, and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) for payment processing.
