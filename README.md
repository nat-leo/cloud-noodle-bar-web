## What We Work With

## The UI

Welcome to the client site source code! This is a React app, which you can learn more about [here](https://reactjs.org). On top of React, we use [MUI](https://mui.com) for styled, prebuilt components. Checkout MUI Core. We used react-bootstrap before, but it was a pain and had less documentation.
