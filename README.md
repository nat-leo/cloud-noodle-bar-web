## What We Work With

## The UI

Welcome to the client site source code! This is a React app, which you can learn more about [here](https://reactjs.org). On top of React, we use [MUI](https://mui.com) for styled, prebuilt components. Checkout MUI Core. We used react-bootstrap before, but it was a pain and had less documentation.

## Backend Services

This website is connected to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for running backend processes, and [Stripe])(https://stripe.com) for payment processing.
